Discovering Cryptic Breeding Sites by Radio Tracking Coconut Rhinoceros
 Beetles,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), 
\shape italic
Oryctes rhinoceros
\shape default
 L., is a serious pest of coconut trees and other palms throughout Southeast
 Asia and on several Pacific Islands.
 Adults kill palms when they bore into crowns to feed on sap.
 Larvae feed only on dead plant material at breeding sites.
 Eradication is possible if all breeding sites are located and destroyed.
 A field trial was performed on Guam to test the feasibility of using radio-tagg
ed adults to discover cryptic breeding sites.
 Of 34 radio-tagged beetles that were released, 19 were successfully tracked
 to landing sites, 14 were lost when they flew beyond the range of our receivers
 and one beetle did not fly.
 Two of the landing sites were confirmed breeding sites as indicated by
 presence of other CRB at the same site.
 None of the radio-tagged beetles were caught in numerous pheromone traps
 in the vicinity of release sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using animals to find aggregations of conspecifics is not a new idea.
 For example, by exploiting the gregarious nature of goats, the Judas goat
 method is a vital tool for detecting goats at low densities and a monitoring
 tool to confirm eradication 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Campbell2005"

\end_inset

.
 Radiotelemetry collars are fitted to select goats, which are released and
 allowed to seek out other goats.
 Judas goats are then radio tracked, either on foot or by helicopter, and
 accompanying goats are shot.
 This approach allows the last individuals to be removed.
 Judas goats have been used successfully in a number of island eradication
 programs.
 Recent development of light-weight, miniaturized radio-tracking transmitters
 now allows application of this technique to insects and other small animals
 which aggregate.
 Here, we report on a field trial to determine the feasability of radio-tracking
 coconut rhinoceros beetles (CRB), 
\emph on
Oryctes rhinoceros
\emph default
 (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) to find cryptic breeding site aggregations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB is a major pest of coconut palm, 
\emph on
Cocos nucifera
\emph default
 L.
 (Arecales: Arecaceae).
 Adult beetles damage and sometimes kill palms when they bore into crowns
 of palms to feed on sap.
 Palms die when boring and feeding activity kills the apical meristem.
 In contrast to adults, CRB grubs cause no damage.
 They feed on decaying vegetation at breeding sites which include dead standing
 coconut palms, fallen coconut logs, rotting coconut stumps and decaying
 wood of many tree species.
 Breeding sites are also found in piles of compost, sawdust and manure where
 these materials are available.

What proportion of a CRB population is found in breeding sites?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 When CRB breeding sites are abundent following damage from typhoons, war,
 or large scale agricultural operations, a self sustaining positive feedback
 loop may be initiated where large numbers of CRB adults kill large numbers
 of palms creating new breeding sites which generate even more CRB.
 This worst case scenerio was observed in Palau when CRB arrived near the
 end of World War II.
 A CRB population outbreak was fueled by availablity of abundant breeding
 sites in the form of trees killed by military activities.
 Fifty per cent of coconut palms were killed by CRB throughout the Palau
 Islands and some of the smaller islands lost all of their coconut palms

After feeding in the crowns of palms, adults of both sexes return to breeding

 Location of breeding sites is facilitated by an aggregation pheromone produced

developed a body mass index, per cent emergent weight (PEW), which is strongly
 correlated with the physiological and behavioral status of CRB adults.
 PEW can be used to estimate current state of a beetle within the feeding-mating
-oviposition cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB first was detected in Guam in the Tumon Bay tourist hotel area in September,
 2007.
 A delimiting survey indicated that the infestation was restricted to only
 a small of the island (<500 ha) and an eradication project was launched
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Smith2008"

\end_inset

.
 The project relied on mass trapping using pheromone traps to capture adults,
 and sanitation to remove rotting vegetation used as breeding sites.
 The traps were baited with the CRB aggregation pheromone, ethyl 4-methyloctanoa
te

 commercially available as oryctalure (P046; ChemTica Iternacional, Heredia,
 Costa Rica).
 Four detector dogs were trained to assist in finding breeding sites on
 the ground by sniffing out CRB grubs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these efforts, CRB damage in central Tumon Bay remained high and
 the infestation spread to all parts of Guam by 2010 making eradication
 unfeasable.

 It has recently been determined that the Guam CRB population is genetically
 different from other populations in Asia and the Pacific and it is considered
 to be a new invasive biotype of of CRB which has escaped from biocontrol
 by OrNV

 In addition to being resistant to all currently available isolates of OrNV,
 it appears that the CRB-Guam biotype behaves differently.
 CRB breeding sites are commonly found in coconut palm crowns on Guam but
 only occasionally elsewhere

 and pheromone traps baited with oryctalure are not very attractive, catching
 only a small proportion of beetles in the vicinity of each trap (Moore,
 unpublished).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eradication of CRB from an island is difficult once this pest has become
 established.
 The only proven tactic for eradication is a vigorous sanitation program
 which discovers and destroys all active and potential breeding sites.
 The single successful CRB eradication to date occured on the tiny (36 km

 surveillance, are not attractive enough to provide significant population
 suppression in mass trapping operations.

\begin_layout Standard
As previously mentioned, four detector dogs for CRB were trained and employed
 for the first time on Guam.
 The dogs were trained to sniff out CRB grubs and it was hoped that they
 would enable us to find remaining, cryptic breeding sites in the final
 stages of eradication.
 The detector dogs were a very expensive component of the Guam CRB eradication
 program and they were retired after two years of service when it became
 evident that eradication was no longer feasable.

In this article, we report results of a field trial intended to test the
 concept of following radio-tagged CRB to cryptic breeding sites as an alternati

Materials and Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Radio Tracking Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All radio tracking equipment was purchased from Advanced Telemetry Systems,
 Isanti, Minnesota.
 We used A2414 glue-on transmitters which weigh 300 mg.
 Each of 32 transmitters used in the trial operated at a unique frequency
 allowing us to track multiple targets simultaneously.
 Two transmitters were reused on two different beetles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used four R410 scanning receivers equiped with three-element folding
 Yagi antennas (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Radio-tracking-reciever-and"

\end_inset

).
 Two recievers operated in the 146 to 150 MHz frequency band and two operated
 in the 162 to 166 MHz band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the 4 trackers used a GPS reciever (Garmin Oregon 650) to record
 waypoints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Collection, Selection and Preparation of Test insects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB used for radio tracking were caught in pheromone traps baited with ethyl
 4-methyloctanoate (Oryctalure; P046; ChemTica Iternacional, Heredia, Costa
 Rica).
 Beetles were removed from the traps within one week of capture, placed
 in tubs containing moist peat moss, fed fresh banana slices and allowed
 to rest for at least three days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beetles were selected for flight capability at least one day prior to use
 in the radio-tracking trial.
 Groups of about 30 beetles were placed in moist peat moss in a metal bowl
 which they could exit only by flight.
 The bowl was supported on a stand inside a flight chamber consisting of
 a large (121 liter) grabage container and a lid was afixed.
 Beetles were left in the flight chamber overnight.
 Those that ended up on the flight chamber floor were deemed to have flown.
 All others were rejected from the radio-tracking field trial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flight-capable beetles were marked with a unique four-digit code engraved
 on one elytrum using a laser engraver (Fenix Flyer, Synrad Inc., Mukilteo,
 WA, United States).
 The sex, mass and elytral dimensions of each beetle were recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A transmitter were glued to the pronotum of each beetle using a hot-melt
 glue gun (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Radio-tracking-reciever-and"

\end_inset

).
 Prior to transmitter attachment, the beetle pronotum was abraded with sandpaper
 to improve adhesion.
 Each glue-on transmitter had a mass of approximately 300 mg and was secured
 with approximately 250 mg of adhesive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Test insects were stored and transported in lidded plastic bins approximately
 (45 cm by 30 cm by 18 cm) containing about 12 cm of damp peat moss.
 Because not all beetles were released when first taken into the field,
 some beetles remained in storage for up to six days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Release Sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio-tagged CRB were released and tracked at two locations on Guam: the
 University of Guam Agricultural Research Station in Yigo and the War in
 the Pacific National Historical Park in Asan (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Beetle-tracks."

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Yigo site is an inland agricultural experiment station farm bordered
 by a residential area and uncultivated forest areas that include coconut
 palms and other trees.
 At the time of the field trial, most coconut palms on the station were
 showing signs of CRB damage.
 The release site (144.872750º E, 13.531333º N) was in the middle of an uncultivat
ed field.
 Beetles were released in the vicinity of three types of pheromone traps
 baited with oryctalure: standard vaned bucket traps (n=3 traps), barrel
 traps (n=31), and DeFence traps (n=4).
 Vaned bucket traps are the standard pheromone traps for CRB developed by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Barrel traps and DeFence traps are experimental designs (A.
 M., unpublished).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Asan site is roughly triangular with the ocean bordering one side, coastal
 wetlands on another, and forested hillside on the third.
 The park itself is a large, open, grassy field and includes with coconut
 palms on the edges, many of which displayed CRB damage at the time of the
 study.
 The release site (144.708537º E, 13.473904º N) was at the middle of a large
 grassy field.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Tracking Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beetles were transported to release sites in plastic storage bins.
 The lid of the bin was removed at dusk (roughly 19:30) and the container
 was closed at roughly 21:30.
 Once the containers were opened, CRB activity was carefully monitored using
 a thermal camera (FLIR Systems Inc., Wilsonville, Oregon; E4 infrared camera).
 Observation under the infrared camera revealed that a beetle's flight muscles
 warm to about 37º C in preparation for flight.
 Pre-flight beetles were briefly viewed under red light to record the identifica
tion number and determine the frequency of the radio transmitter.
 Though nearly all beetles flew independently, several beetles that had
 not yet flown by the end of experimentation were encouraged to flight by
 removing them from the peat moss and throwing them into the air to facilitate
 takeoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB were pursued on foot following release and were tracked until a landing
 site was determined or until the transmitter signal was lost.
 In either case, a waypoint was recorded at the landing site or the last
 point of signal reception using a GPS unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Landing sites were visited on the following morning, and attempts were made
 to more precisely determine the location of each beetle.
 Beetle locations were monitored over several days, and beetles and or transmitt
ers were recovered, when possible, at the end of the experiment.
 CRB and transmitters were successfully recovered by digging up beetles
 that buried into soil or compost; however the locations of CRB tracked
 to coconut crowns could not be as exactly determined due to the density
 of the frond foliage.

\begin_layout Section*
Results and Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weather conditions during the field trial were mainly clear with occasional
 periods of rain and overcast skies.
 On release dates, August 8 to August 14, average temperature ranged from
 27°C to 29°C and relative humidity was between 80% to 88%.
 Beetles were generally tracked under clear skies with the exception of
 August 9 during which light showers occurred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Breeding Site Discovery
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of 34 radio-tagged beetles that were released, 19 were successfully tracked
 to landing sites, 14 were lost when they flew beyond the range of the receivers
 and one beetle did not fly (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Outcomes-for-radio-tracked"

\end_inset

).
 Most of CRB tracked to landing sites were in tree tops (n=11) and the rest
 were on or below the ground (n=8).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two of the landing sites were confirmed breeding sites as indicated by the
 presence of other CRB at the same site.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first breeding site we discovered by radio-tracking was in an extremely
 cryptic and unsuspected microhabitat: in a hole in a large rotting branch
 of a breadfruit tree (
\emph on
Artocarpus altilis
\emph default
), about six meters above the ground.
 In this case, the receiver had become detached and the marked beetle was
 not recovered.
 However, 3 other CRB adults were occupying the hole.
 It is highly likely that this breeding site was in a branch broken by high
 winds experienced when Typhoon Dolphin passed over Guam in May 2015, about
 3 months before the radio-tracking trial.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second breeding site we discovered was beneath a barrel trap.

 NEED DESCRIPTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ten landing sites in coconut palm crowns were considered to be potential
 breeding sites but we did not have time or equipment to confirm these.
 Arboreal breeding sites may be common on Guam (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Tracks and Displacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance between release sites and landing sites was calculated for the
 19 beetles tracked to a landing site.
 The remaining 14 beetles flew beyond the range of our radio receivers,
 about 500 m.
 Mean displacement could not be estimated, but median displacement was 333
 m, with no significant difference between release sites (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Displacement-of-beetles"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is little information available on the natural flight range of CRB.
 In a laboratory experiment, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "1645"

\end_inset

 observed that tethered beetles attached to a flight mill flew between 2
 and 4 km with a flight duration of 2 to 3 hours.
 However, field observations indicate that natural flight is limited to
 a few hundred meters and this distance is influenced by the availability
 of feeding or breeding sites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 performed a mark-release-recapture study in a small (4.5 ha) oil palm replanting
 area containing a grid of 49 pheromone traps.
 Beetles captured in the traps were were marked with the trap number and
 released.
 Five of these beetles were recaptured in traps and displacement was calculated.
 Unfortunately, the total number of marked beetles released is not reported.
 Displacement averaged 118 m with a range of 51 m to 186 m.
 The authors acknowledg shortcomings of their study: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

These values may be below the actual flight potential as their flights were
 monitored using pheromone traps.
 However, the conducive environment, availability of food and abundant breeding
 sites in the replanting area logically play a role in the flight distance.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mass relationships
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Masses of CRB landing on the ground were not significantly different than
 those landing in treetops for females (4.486 g, 4.407 g; Welch's t = 0.117;
 p = 0.914) and males (3.638 g; 5.043 g; Welch's t = -2.2749; p = 0.053).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, mean percent emergent weight of CRB landing on the ground was higher
 than those landing in treetops (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Percent-emergence-weight"

\end_inset

).
 A possible explanation for this observation is that individuals with low
 percent emergent weight were hungry and therefore flew to treetops in order
 to bore into crowns to feed and beetles with lower percent emergence weight
 were searching for breeding sites in which to ovipost or find mates.
 Thus, if the objective is to locate ground based breeding sites, beetles
 with low PEW should be selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Response to Traps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the fact that beetles were released within proximity of active phermone
 traps, none were trapped.
 The mean trap catch rate of pheromone traps at the Yigo experiment station
 during August 2015 was 0.03 beetles per trap-day for standard bucket traps
 (n=3 traps), 0.13 for barrel traps (n=31), and 0.15 for DeFence traps (n=4).
 In addition, no marked beetles were trapped in fish gill netting draped
 over a greenwaste pile at the Yigo site.
 This pile trapped 0.50 beetles per trap-day during August 2015.
 
\series bold
TRAP LOCATIONS AND CATCH DATA FOR ASAN NEEDED.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we assume that the wild beetles respond to traps in the same way as the
 radio-tagged beetles, then we can estimate that the suite of traps in the
 vicinity of the the release points catches less than one in 33 (<3%) of
 wild beetles.
 This low trap performance is consistant with results from previous mark-release
-recapture data from Guam (A.
 M., unpublished).
 It is possible that oryctalure is less attractive to individuals of the
 CRB Guam biotype than to individuals of other other biotypes.
 Results indicate that none of the currently available CRB trapping methods
 are usefull for population reduction of CRB-Guam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Why CRB is a Good Candidate for Radio Tracking as a Method for Finding Conspecif
ics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB has characteristics which make this species a good candidate for radio
 tracking.
 First, this is a large, powerful beetle which can fly with the additional
 mass of a transmitter.
 Second, CRB aggregates at breeding sites.
 And third, CRB do not fly during the day, providing time to precisely locate
 landing points.
 Although 14 tagged beetles were lost when they flew beyond the range of
 our receivers, it is probable that we could have tracked these to precise
 landing sites with the use of a helicopter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our feasability study was a success in that all but one of the 34 radio-tagged
 beetles flew and two of these were tracked to cryptic breeding sites confirmed
 by the presence of other CRB.
 If this 'Judas beetle' method is to be used in an eradication program,
 there may be concerns about introduction of additional CRB adults.
 In this case, perhaps only sterile males should be used.

Results of radio-tracking coconut rhinoceros beetles at the Yigo and Asan
 release sites.
 Pushpin icons represent waypoints for tracked beetles (color code: red
 = beetle ended up in crown of tree; yellow: beetle ended up on or below
 the ground; orange: beetle was lost when it flew beyond the range of radio-trac
king receivers, orange lines are extrapolated tracks based on last observed
 bearing of radio signal).
 Circular icons represent pheromone traps (color code: cyan = barrel trap;
 orange = DeFence trap; red = bucket trap).

\end_inset

Displacement of beetles from release points within 48 h.
 The points at 500 m indicate beetles that flew beyond the range of the
 radio-tracking recievers.
 Difference between medians for beetles released at the two sites (Asan:
 418 m; Yigo: 275 m) are not significantly different (p = 0.36; bootstrap
 resampling with 10,000 iterations).
 Pooled median displacement was 333 m.
