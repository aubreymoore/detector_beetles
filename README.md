# detector_beetles
This repo contains data, analysis and documents for a field trial performed on Guam during August 2015 to test the 
feasability of following radio-tagged coconut rhinoceros beetles to cryptic breeding sites. 

Note: The repo is in a bit of a mess right now because I am a noobie at gist. All of the current files are in a 
folder with the stupid name [4045191vqgrvx] (https://github.com/aubreymoore/detector_beetles/tree/master/4045191vqgrvx).
