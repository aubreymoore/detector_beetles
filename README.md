# detector_beetles
This repo contains data, analysis and documents for a field trial performed on Guam during August 2015 to test the 
feasability of following radio-tagged coconut rhinoceros beetles to cryptic breeding sites. 

Note: The repo is in a bit of a mess right now because I am a noobie at gist. All of the current files are in a 
folder with the stupid name [4045191vqgrvx] (https://github.com/aubreymoore/detector_beetles/tree/master/4045191vqgrvx).

## Data
All data is saved in a couple of text (*.csv) files:
* detector_beetles.csv
* trap_locations.csv

## Analysis
Analysis including statistics and generation of figures is done in an iPython notebook:
* [detector_beetles.ipynb](https://github.com/aubreymoore/detector_beetles/blob/master/4045191vqgrvx/detector_beetles.ipynb)

## Documents
A journal article on the field trial is being prepared using LyX (version 2.1.4), which generates a pdf file. Dependencies for the LyX file are some bibliography files (\*.bib) and some graphics (\*.png).

### Input 
* detector_beetles.lyx
* *.bib
* *.png

### Output
* [detector_beetles.pdf](https://github.com/aubreymoore/detector_beetles/blob/master/4045191vqgrvx/detector_beetles.pdf)
